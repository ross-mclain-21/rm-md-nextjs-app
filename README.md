# McLain Development

I built this starting with the Auth0 Next.JS template then created the rest.
## Project setup

Use `npm` to install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Compile and hot-reload for development

This compiles and serves the Next.js app and starts the API server on port 3001.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

### Compiles and minifies for production

```bash
npm run build
# then
npm run start
```
